        <p id="realmR">2018 has been a year where battle royal games seem to have dominated the industry. While Fortnite and PUBG have recieved the majority of the attention
            Realm Royal has been growing in popularity and offers a similar but refreshingly diffrent game play. Like Fortnite it is free to play and offers season passes or 
            "Battle Passes" where players can earn a variety of items. Each game features multiple charaters with unique abilities and you have the option of squading up with friends
            or trying to get a win solo. If you have not had the chance to play it is currently only available on steam but developer Hi-Rez Studios say they want to transition to console.
            If you have not had the chance to play I would defenetly recommend check it out.   </p>
